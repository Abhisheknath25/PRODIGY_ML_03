🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier using SVM

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs. It uses Python, OpenCV, and scikit-learn for image processing, training, and evaluation.

📌 Features

Load and preprocess cat and dog images from a dataset folder.

Resize and flatten images for SVM input.

Train a linear SVM classifier on the dataset.

Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification report.

Predict new images with proper error handling.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

OpenCV (cv2) for image loading and preprocessing

NumPy for array handling

scikit-learn for SVM and evaluation metrics

tqdm for progress bars
